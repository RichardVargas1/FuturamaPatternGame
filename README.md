## react_clicky_game
A memory game with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions:

* This app renders different images of Futurama Charcters to your display.

* This app also keeps track of your score. Your score will be increased when you click on a character, for the first time. 

* The score will be reset to "0", if you happen to click on the same character more than once (REMEMBER WHO YOU CLICK ON).

* Every time a character is clicked on, the other Futurama characters will be rendered in a random fashion.

* The application wil restart once you get an incorrect guess. However, your high score will stil be tallied.
